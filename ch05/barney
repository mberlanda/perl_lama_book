Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of strings on separate lines,
printing each string in a right-justified, 20-character column. To be certain that the
output is in the proper columns, print a “ruler line” of digits as well. (This is simply
a debugging aid.) Make sure that you’re not using a 19-character column by mis-
take! For example, entering hello , good-bye should give output something like this:
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
hello
good-bye
