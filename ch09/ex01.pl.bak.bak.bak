=begin
Make a pattern that will match three consecutive copies of whatever is currently
contained in $what . That is, if $what is fred , your pattern should match fred
fredfred . If $what is fred|barney , your pattern should match fredfredbarney or
barneyfredfred or barneybarneybarney or many other variations. (Hint: you should
set $what at the top of the pattern test program with a statement like my $what =
'fred|barney'; .)

print "what do you want to match?\n";
chomp($what =<STDIN>);
print "what match $what?\n";
while(<STDIN>){
  chomp;
  if (/($what){3}/){
    print "Matched: |$`<$&>$`|\n";
  } else {
    print "No match: |$_|\n";
