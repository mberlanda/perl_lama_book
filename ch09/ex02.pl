=begin
Write a program that makes a modified copy of a text file. In the copy, every
string Fred (case-insensitive) should be replaced with Larry . (So, Manfred Mann
should become ManLarry Mann .) The input filename should be given on the com-
mand line (donâ€™t ask the user!), and the output filename should be the corre-
sponding filename ending with .out .
